# TPA miscellaneous scripts

A random collection of sysadmin scripts that can't seem to fit
anywhere else.

## Project inventory

Here are the known objects here:

 * `fabric_tpa`: our growing pile of code built around [Fabric][],
   typically a library for other tools in the top level directory, but
   many functions can be called directly, see `fab -l` after
   installing fabric

 * `fabric.yml`, `fabfile.py`: configuration files for Fabric

 * `find-crontabs.py`: a prototype experimenting with [Mitogen][] as a
   Fabric replacement

 * `ganeti`: a bunch of tools for managing Ganeti clusters

 * `handle-abuse.py`: pipe an abuse message from Hetzner in there to
   unsubscribe users from [CiviCRM][] (among, hopefully, other things)

 * `install`: Fabric-based installer

 * `installer`: a lot of legacy installers, some of which are still in
   use

 * `multi-tool`: legacy, should be replaced by `cumin` or the `reboot`
   fabric script

 * `reboot`: a script to reboot or halt servers reliably, built with
   Fabric

 * `reboot-guest`, `reboot-host`: legacy reboot scripts

 * `retire`: a script to (partially) retire a server, built with
   Fabric

## What belongs here

If you have a small script that is very minimal and won't grow much
more, and that it's designed to run from your workstation (and not the
remote servers) it might be a good place for it.

If, on the other hand, it's a script that should be run directly on
servers managed by Puppet, it might be better to deploy that script
through the `tor-puppet.git` repository.

## Caveats

This README file should probably be expanded to cover a little more
about the history of this project, its authors, and possible fate(s).

In particular, we might want to move all the Fabric-related Python
code to its own repository, with CI and all that jazz.
