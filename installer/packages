# this list was originally generated from the following sed command,
# to remove superfluous packages from the base grml-debootstrap set:
#
# sed -e '/^bridge-utils$/d;
#         /^bzip2$/d;
#         /^file$/d;
#         /^ifenslave$/d;
#         /^lsof$/d;
#         /^most$/d;
#         /^os-prober$/d;
#         /^postfix$/d;
#         /^resolvconf$/d;
#         /^strace$/d;
#         /^vlan$/d;
#         /^zsh$/d;
#         $adbus
#         $acryptsetup-initramfs
#         ' /etc/debootstrap/packages
#
# but now it seems simpler and better to just manage the list of
# *included* packages that the list of *excluded* packages, as both
# are about as long. the above can be reused to regenerate the
# following list, however.
