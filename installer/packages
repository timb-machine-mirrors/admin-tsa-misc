# this list was originally generated from the following sed command,
# to remove superfluous packages from the base grml-debootstrap set:
#
# sed -e 's/postfix//;
#         s/vlan//;
#         s/bridge-utils//;
#         s/ifenslave//;
#         s/resolvconf//;
#         s/zsh//;
#         s/strace//;
#         s/os-prober//;
#         s/bzip2//;
#         s/file//;
#         s/lsof//;
#         s/most//;
#         $adbus
#         $acryptsetup-initramfs
#         ' /etc/debootstrap/packages
#
# but now it seems simpler and better to just manage the list of
# *included* packages that the list of *excluded* packages, as both
# are about as long. the above can be reused to regenerate the
# following list, however.
