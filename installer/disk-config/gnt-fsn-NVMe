# disk configuration for PX62+2x10TB machines in the gnt-fsn cluster
#
# this configures a /boot+RAID+LUKS+LVM stack on top of the first two
# NVMe SSD drives, with a 30G root and 1G swap.
#
# a RAID+LUKS+LVM stack is laid on the extra two hard drives, but no
# logical volume is created.
#
# an older version of this was used to install fsn-node-03
#
# Documentation on this file format is available in the setup-storage(8) manpage.

# configure a 512m tmpfs
#
# the default is RAM:50% according to tmpfs(5), but the most common
# config is currently 512m.
#
# it might be better to leave this be the default from tmpfs, without
# specifying anything. but this would lead to huge tmpfs on large
# machines and it is not supported by FAI, so leave that be for now,
# see: https://bugs.debian.org/951659
#
# 512MiB may be a little small for some hosts, but the point of this
# is not to set configuration forever, but to bootstrap *something*
# that works. see also this ticket for further discussion:
# https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/33387
