# disk configuration for PX62+2x10TB machines in the gnt-fsn cluster
#
# this configures a /boot+RAID+LUKS+LVM stack on top of the first two
# NVMe SSD drives, with a 30G root and 1G swap.
#
# a RAID+LUKS+LVM stack is laid on the extra two hard drives, but no
# logical volume is created.
#
# an older version of this was used to install fsn-node-03
#
# Documentation on this file format is available in the setup-storage(8) manpage.

# configure a tempfs with defaults, which is RAM:50% according to tmpfs(5)
#
# TODO: we should leave this default into the tmpfs driver and not
# override it here, but setup-storage insists on having that setting
# here, see https://bugs.debian.org/951659
